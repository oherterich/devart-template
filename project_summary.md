## Description
Computers hold an interesting place in our lives. At points they are god-like, performing tasks and queries that we could never dream of achieving. Other times, however, they are our servants, stupid robots that fail to understand the simplest request. What happens when we place this machine as an equal, and situate the vast intelligence and stupidity of a computer directly across from ourselves? Do we treat it as a box of parts, or as a sympathetic ear? 

I’m Feeling Lucky is an installation that explores the relationship between human desire and artificial intelligence. Visitors are prompted with the simple question, "What do you want?" This might be as simple as a sandwich, or as complex as true love, but every desire is processed the same way. A collage of images and text will be created from your request and printed, a reminder of how the trust we place in our computers sometimes has unexpected results.
