###Beginnings

At its most basic level, this project is about the relationship between technology and us. Often, we see computers or the Internet as extensions of ourselves, less a tool and more a way of defining our interests, satisfying our curiosity, and maintaining our relationships. In a way, technology is a reflection of self, at both an individual and a societal level. 

As the web continues to permeate every aspect of human life, our dreams and desires are being shaped by this human - machine interaction. Our collective imagination is now powered by an algorithmic indexing and ranking which is highly biased towards simple concepts like colors, faces, and context in the website. 

###Inspiration

Much of the inspiration for this project exists in the intersection between human and machine interpretation. We're interested in how inherently human characteristics, such as emotion, spirituality, and desire are defined and decoded by the computer.

[The News Machine](http://www.colorsmagazine.com/blog/article/colors-86-launches-at-the-international-journalism-festival) passes tweets through various media filters and technologies. At the end, they are presented as a "headline," but more often than not the resulting headline has been distorted and changed as it passed through the technologies.

[Noplace](http://www.bewitched.com/noplace.html) is a project by Mark Wattenberg that takes feeds of images, sound, and text and uses it to create various utopian visons. The resulting collages of information do not always seem utopian; sometimes, they are dark, hellish, or completely indecipherable.

![Google](../project_images/google-book.jpg?raw=true "Google")

[Google](http://www.creativeapplications.net/scripts/google-the-first-google-image-for-every-word-in-the-dictionary/) is a book that contains the first Google image for every word in the dictionary. There's no bias in the book; the results are straight from Google, and the image used is not curated or selected. It's a machine's representation of human language, which is interesting in itself.

[Google Poetics](http://www.googlepoetics.com/) is a site that I've been frequenting for quite a while. There's something very poignant about some of these poems, even though they're completely generated by Google Instant Search.

![Post Secret](../project_images/post-secret.jpg?raw=true "Post Secret")

[Post Secret](http://postsecret.com/) is an inspiration mostly for it's aesthetic qualties, and the way they tie into the emotional aspect of Post Secret. In our project, we want to print out an image that summarizes what the visitor to the installation said to the machine. I really like the collage aesthetics of the postcards in Post Secret, as well as the typography. There's a nice handmade and emotional quality to the images, which gets to the core of what Post Secret is trying to accomplish.

###Up Next
Stay tuned as Jorge and I begin prototyping the basic functionality of the project. We will also be designing the installation space further, as the interaction between the visitor and computer is a key aspect of the project. Until next time!
